# django-recover
A web-based tool to help collaboratively recover your Facebook history after perminently removing the account.

This only works for a version of the backups that occured back in about 2014, and not more recent ones, because they of course keep changing the formats, and I was only concerned about myself for this project.

This project also ties in with the Facebook API so that people can actually log in to your site and verify their identity.
