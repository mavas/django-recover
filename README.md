# django-recover
A web-based tool to help collaboratively recover your Facebook history after permanently removing the account.

## Limitations

This only works for a version of the backups that occured back in about 2014, and not more recent backup versions, because they of course keep changing/updating the formats, and this project is only concerned about a specific time.

This project also ties in with the Facebook API so that people can actually log in to your site and verify their identity before confirming content.
